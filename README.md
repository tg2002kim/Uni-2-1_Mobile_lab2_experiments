## AI Experiments on PIMA Diabetes Dataset

### Overview

The AI lab focused on exploring core supervised learning models on a real-world dataset ‚Äì the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**. The students implemented regression and classification tasks using **scikit-learn** in Python, with Google Colab as the development environment.

### Learning Goals

- Understand the difference between regression and classification.
- Learn how to use scikit-learn for modeling.
- Explore feature-target relationships and model performance.
- Evaluate models using metrics such as MSE, accuracy, and confusion matrix.

### Theory Recap

#### üî∏ Supervised Learning

Predicts an output \( y \) based on input \( X \), formulated as:  
`y = f(X) + Œµ`  
Where:
- `f(X)`: true relationship between input and output
- `Œµ`: irreducible noise

#### üî∏ Types
- **Regression**: Continuous output prediction (e.g., glucose level)
- **Classification**: Discrete label prediction (e.g., diabetic or not)

#### üî∏ scikit-learn API Flow
```python
from sklearn.model import ModelType
model = ModelType(...)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
pred = model.predict(X_test)
